The Chromatic Conversion Engine: Behavioral Mechanics and Algorithmic Optimization of UI Color Palettes
1. Introduction: The Transition from Aesthetic Intuition to Conversion Physics
The discipline of User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design stands at a critical juncture where the subjective artistry of "look and feel" is being rapidly superseded by the objective science of behavioral economics and neuro-aesthetics. For decades, color selection in digital product design was largely the domain of creative intuition, guided by loose theories of brand personality and artistic harmony. However, as the digital ecosystem becomes increasingly saturated, the margin for error in user retention has evaporated. In this high-velocity environment, color is no longer merely a decorative layer; it is a fundamental functional variable—a distinct carrier of information, a regulator of cognitive load, and a prime mover in the mechanics of decision-making.
This report presents an exhaustive analysis of the behavioral psychology underpinning high-conversion color palettes, specifically tailored to inform the architectural logic of a data-backed recommendation engine. The objective is to move beyond the superficial application of "color theory" and into the realm of "conversion physics"—quantifiable, replicable, and falsifiable rules that govern how specific wavelengths of light influence human behavior on digital screens. By synthesizing findings from seminal academic papers 1, industry-standard usability reports from the Nielsen Norman Group 3, and large-scale A/B testing datasets from platforms like Google and HubSpot 4, we aim to construct a rigorous framework for a color palette visualizer application.
The analysis is structured to address the specific "Key Research Areas" identified in the study objective: the chronometry of first impressions (the 90-second vs. 50-millisecond debate), the neuro-semantics of trust in financial technology (Fintech), the gendered perception of saturation in minimalist aesthetics, the biological mechanics of the "Isolation Effect" in Call-to-Action (CTA) design, the cognitive economics of the 60-30-10 rule, and the physiological constraints of luminosity in accessibility.
Ultimately, this report argues that a robust recommendation engine must operate not as a random generator of aesthetically pleasing hues, but as a "compliance engine" that filters color choices through the hard constraints of human biology and the soft constraints of cultural conditioning. The resulting output provides specific Hex-range recommendations and algorithmic logic gates for three distinct design archetypes: "High-Trust Professional," "Modern Growth/Tech," and "Luxury Minimalist."

2. The Chronometry of First Impressions: From 90 Seconds to 50 Milliseconds
The design of a recommendation engine must essentially optimize for time. Understanding the precise window of opportunity available to influence a user is critical for determining which visual attributes—color, layout, or typography—must be prioritized. The "90-second rule" has long been a staple of marketing literature, but in the context of a mobile-first, infinite-scroll digital environment, this timeline requires rigorous re-examination.
2.1 The "90-Second" Baseline: Satyendra Singh’s Macro-Judgment Theory
The foundational metric often cited in color psychology is derived from Satyendra Singh’s seminal paper, Impact of Color on Marketing (2006).1 Singh’s meta-analysis of color in retail and product marketing posited a dramatic statistic: individuals make up their minds within 90 seconds of their initial interaction with people or products, and 62-90% of this assessment is based on colors alone.5
2.1.1 The Theoretical Underpinnings
Singh’s findings were rooted in the concept of the "Unstable Mood." He argued that human moods and feelings are transient and unstable; therefore, the brain seeks consistent external stimuli to anchor its attitude toward a product. Color provides this anchor. It is ubiquitous and carries a high information density that can be decoded faster than text or shape. In a physical retail environment—the primary context of 2006—a consumer walking down an aisle would scan products, and the color of the packaging (e.g., a yellow box of cereal vs. a black box of gourmet chocolate) would trigger an immediate categorization of "value" vs. "premium".7
2.1.2 The "Color-Attitude" Link
The 62-90% statistic suggests that color is the primary variable in the "Prototype Matching" process. When a user encounters a product, they compare it against an internal mental prototype. If the product is a "Bank," the mental prototype is likely "Blue/Grey/Structured." If the encountered product is "Pink/Yellow/Chaotic," the mismatch creates cognitive dissonance. Singh’s data implies that this mismatch is detected and rejected within 90 seconds. This timeframe allows for "Reflective Processing"—a conscious, albeit rapid, evaluation of the product's fit.8
However, the digital landscape of 2026 differs radically from the retail landscape of 2006. The interaction cost of clicking a "Back" button on a mobile phone is significantly lower than walking out of a store. Consequently, the tolerance for "mismatch" has plummeted, and the speed of judgment has accelerated.
2.2 The "50-Millisecond" Reality: Lindgaard’s Micro-Judgment Theory
While Singh provides the macroscopic view of judgment formation (the "what"), research by Gitte Lindgaard and colleagues at Carleton University (2006) reveals the microscopic reality of digital interaction (the "when"). Their study, Attention Web Designers: You Have 50 Milliseconds to Make a Good First Impression, demonstrated that users form stable aesthetic judgments of a webpage in as little as 50 milliseconds (0.05 seconds).2
2.2.1 The Experimental Methodology
Lindgaard’s team exposed participants to images of web pages for varying durations (50ms and 500ms) and asked them to rate the pages on "visual appeal." The correlation between the ratings given after a mere 50ms exposure and those given after a 500ms exposure was extremely high (0.91). This suggests that the judgment made in the first blink of an eye is effectively the permanent judgment. The brain does not "correct" this initial impression with more time; rather, it seeks to confirm it (confirmation bias).9
2.2.2 Tuch et al. (2012): The 17ms Threshold
Subsequent research by Tuch et al. (2012) pushed this boundary even further, suggesting that factors like Visual Complexity and Prototypicality influence perceived aesthetics within 17 milliseconds.11 This is faster than the conscious recognition of the image content. At 17-50ms, the brain is not reading text or evaluating the "Value Proposition." It is processing raw visual signal: Luminosity, Contrast, and Saturation.
2.3 The "Visceral" Layer vs. The "Reflective" Layer
To reconcile Singh’s "90 seconds" with Lindgaard’s "50 milliseconds," we must utilize Don Norman’s framework of emotional design, which separates processing into three levels: Visceral, Behavioral, and Reflective.
1. Visceral Processing (0 – 50ms): This is the automatic, pre-conscious layer. It is governed by the Lindgaard effect. Here, the brain reacts to "Color Harmony" vs. "Color Clash." High visual complexity or poor contrast (e.g., red text on a blue background) triggers a physiological "avoidance" response before the user is even aware of what they are looking at. This is where the Bounce Rate is determined.
2. Behavioral/Reflective Processing (50ms – 90s): Once the user "survives" the visceral check, they enter Singh’s 90-second window. Here, they consciously evaluate the semantics. "This is a bank, but it's painted neon green. Do I trust it?" This is where the 62-90% weight of color association kicks in.
2.4 Implications for the Recommendation Engine
The data indicates that a mobile-first recommendation engine must operate with a two-phase validation logic:
* Phase 1: The Biological Gate (The 50ms Check): The engine must prioritize Luminosity Contrast and Visual Complexity reduction. Before suggesting which colors to use (Blue vs. Red), it must ensure the relationship between the colors does not cause "Chromostereopsis" (visual vibration) or retinal fatigue. If a palette fails the 50ms "Visceral" test, the user will bounce before the 90-second "Semantic" evaluation can occur.9
* Phase 2: The Semantic Gate (The 90s Check): Once the palette is biologically sound, the engine must optimize for "Prototypicality." If the user selects "Fintech," the engine must restrict the Hue range to those associated with stability (Blue/Grey) to satisfy the user's internal prototype during the 90-second evaluation window.11
Synthesis of Insight: The "90-Second Rule" is the window for persuasion, but the "50-Millisecond Rule" is the window for retention. A high-conversion palette must first pass the biological test of the first 50ms to earn the right to persuade in the subsequent 90 seconds.

3. The Neuro-Semantics of Trust: Deconstructing the "Blue Standard" in Fintech
In the vertical of Financial Technology (Fintech) and B2B SaaS, color selection is rarely a matter of artistic expression; it is a mechanism for risk reduction. The industry standardization around "Deep Navy," "Slate Blue," and "Charcoal" is not coincidental but rooted in evolutionary psychology and confirmed by color-emotion association studies. The recommendation engine must understand why these colors work to effectively replicate their success.
3.1 The Psychology of Blue: Stability, Competence, and the "Invariant"
Blue is consistently cited as the most universally preferred color across genders and cultures, with studies showing preference rates often exceeding 50%.13 In the context of finance, blue activates psychological associations with competence, stability, and security.
3.1.1 Evolutionary Basis of Blue
Evolutionary psychology posits that human color associations are derived from environmental constants. Blue is the color of the clear sky and calm water—signals of a non-threatening environment conducive to survival. Unlike Red (associated with fire, blood, and acute danger) or Yellow (associated with the sun, toxicity, or warning), Blue lowers physiological arousal. It reduces heart rate and blink frequency, creating a state of "calm focus".13
For a Fintech application, where the user is often performing high-stress tasks (transferring money, checking debt, investing), the UI must act as a physiological depressant. It must counteract the user's anxiety. A "Red" interface would amplify the anxiety of a negative balance; a "Blue" interface mitigates it.
3.1.2 The "Navy" Authority: Weight and Permanence
Darker shades of blue, specifically Navy (#000080 range), are linked to authority, tradition, and permanence. This is why legacy institutions (Chase, Citi, Amex) and modern giants (Stripe, PayPal) utilize these hues.
In color psychology, "Darkness" (low value) correlates with "Weight." A Navy header feels "heavy" and "grounded," metaphorically anchoring the interface. This visual weight suggests that the institution is immovable and permanent—a critical attribute for an entity holding a user’s life savings.15
* Recommendation Logic: The engine should define a "Trust Anchor" range for headers and primary backgrounds in Fintech modes, specifically prioritizing Hue 210°–230° with Luminance < 20% (Deep Navy).16
3.2 The "Slate" and "Charcoal" Factor: Sophistication via Desaturation
Modern Fintech interfaces have evolved away from the "Hyperlink Blue" (pure #0000FF) of the early internet toward sophisticated variations like Slate Blue and Charcoal. This shift represents a move from "Utility" to "Sophistication."
3.2.1 The Mechanism of Desaturation (Tones)
Slate Blue (e.g., #4E5F70) is created by introducing Grey into the Blue hue (desaturation).
* The Signal: High saturation (Pure Blue) signals "Childhood," "Toys," or "Basic Utility." It is loud and demands attention.
* The Nuance: Desaturation signals "Complexity" and "Refinement." By mixing the hue, the color becomes more subtle. Slate Blue retains the "Trust" association of Blue but gains the "Neutrality" and "Balance" of Grey. This reduces the emotional intensity of the interface, preventing it from feeling "gamified," which is crucial for B2B software where serious work occurs.17
3.2.2 Charcoal vs. Black: The Readability Factor
The "Charcoal" trend (e.g., #36454F) has largely replaced pure Black (#000000) in text and dark mode backgrounds.
* Halation and Eye Strain: Pure black text on a white background (or white on black) creates maximum contrast (21:1). While "High Contrast" is generally good, maximum contrast can cause "Halation" (a visual vibration or glowing effect) for users with astigmatism.
* The Charcoal Solution: Charcoal softens this contrast slightly (e.g., to 18:1 or 15:1). It is easier on the retina for long-form reading (e.g., reading a bank statement or a contract). Furthermore, Charcoal is perceived as "Modern Professional," whereas pure Black is perceived as "Stark" or "Default".15
3.3 Case Study: Stripe’s "Blurple" and the Modern Shift
Stripe represents the gold standard in modern Fintech UI, often cited by designers as the "North Star" of the industry. Their palette does not rely on a single static Navy but a dynamic range that the engine should emulate.16
* The Anchor: Downriver (#0A2540) – A deep, almost black navy used for text and primary UI elements. This conveys the absolute authority of a bank.
* The Innovator: Cornflower Blue / "Blurple" (#635BFF) – A vibrant, highly saturated violet-blue used for accents and CTAs.
   * Insight: This specific hue (#635BFF) bridges the gap between "Blue" (Trust) and "Purple" (Creativity/Future). It signals that the platform is "Tech-Forward" and "Innovative" (Purple traits) while remaining safely within the "Blue" spectrum to maintain trust. It differentiates Stripe from "Old Money" banks that use duller navys.
Summary for Engine: For the "High-Trust Professional" category, the engine must enforce a Hue restriction between 200°–240° for primary backgrounds/headers. However, it must allow for Saturation variance: Low Saturation (Slate) for backgrounds to reduce noise, and High Saturation (Blurple) for Accents to signal innovation.

4. The "Masculine" Minimalist Aesthetic: Saturation, Gender, and Sophistication
The user query identifies a "Masculine Minimalist" aesthetic, focusing on "desaturated" vs. "vibrant" pastels and the use of "grey/black tones." Research into color perception and gender confirms distinct biological and psychological preferences that validate this design pattern for specific target demographics.
4.1 Gender Differences in Color Perception: Biology and Culture
Research by Hallock (2003) and McInnis & Shearer provides robust data on gender-based color preferences. These differences are statistically significant and critical for an engine designing for gender-specific or "gender-neutral" demographics.
4.1.1 Hue Preferences
* The Blue Consensus: Both men and women consistently rank Blue as their favorite color (57% of men, 35% of women).4 This makes Blue the safest "Gender-Neutral" base.
* The Purple Divide: The most distinct divergence lies in the color Purple. Women rank Purple as a top-tier favorite (23%), while men consistently rank it as a least favorite (0% to <5%).
   * Engine Logic: If the prompt is "Masculine," the engine must strictly exclude Purple/Violet hues (unless heavily darkened into a "Midnight" shade).
* The Brown Dislike: Both genders dislike Brown and Orange, associating them with "Dirt" or "Cheapness" in many contexts.4
4.1.2 Tints vs. Shades
A critical, often overlooked distinction lies in the preference for Shades (Hue + Black) vs. Tints (Hue + White).
* Male Preference for Shades: Men are statistically more likely to prefer colors that have been darkened (Shades). This aligns with the "Dark Mode" and "Charcoal" aesthetics prevalent in developer tools, gaming, and crypto interfaces.
* Female Preference for Tints: Women show a higher affinity for colors that have been lightened (Tints), i.e., "Pastels."
* The "Sophistication" of Tones: Both genders perceive Tones (Hue + Grey) as more sophisticated than pure hues. A "Tone" is complex; it requires mixing. Pure hues are "primary" and "childlike."
4.2 The Physics of "Sophistication" in Minimalism
The "Masculine Minimalist" aesthetic described in the query relies on the manipulation of Chroma (Saturation).
* Vibrant Pastels (High Saturation Tints): Colors like "Baby Blue" or "Mint Green" (High Lightness, High Saturation) are often perceived as "Infantile" or "Playful."
* Muted Pastels (Low Saturation Tones): By lowering the saturation (e.g., from 80% to 20%), a "Baby Blue" becomes "Steel Blue" or "Fog." A "Mint Green" becomes "Sage."
   * Psychological Impact: Lowering saturation reduces the "emotional noise" of the color. A Sage Green (#7C8363) feels "curated" and "expensive" because it implies a specific, intentional mixing process. It signals that the brand is confident enough to whisper, rather than shout.19
4.3 The "Luxury Minimalist" Palette Structure
Luxury minimalism relies on the "absence of color" as a status signal. High-end brands (e.g., Apple, luxury fashion houses, architectural firms) utilize a palette that emphasizes texture and material over hue.
* Dominant: Off-White or Bone (#F2EFEA). Pure white (#FFFFFF) is often too sterile and "default." A "Bone" or "Ivory" tint adds warmth and implies a physical material (like paper or stone) without adding visual clutter.
* Secondary: Rich Black or Charcoal (#0D0D0D). This is the "Vantablack" effect. It provides maximum contrast against the Bone background, creating crisp, typographic authority.
* Accent: Metallic Tones (#A57A03 Gold / Copper). Gold provides a "prestige" cue. In a minimalist palette, a small touch of Gold acts as jewelry. It contrasts effectively with the matte finish of the neutrals, drawing the eye to the most valuable elements (e.g., "Checkout" or "Premium Plan").21
Summary for Engine: For "Luxury Minimalist" or "Masculine" inputs, the engine should automatically cap Saturation at 20-30% for all primary colors. It should prioritize Shades (low luminance) over Tints for secondary colors, and strictly filter out Purple/Pink hues unless specifically requested.

5. Conversion & The Isolation Effect: The Physics of the CTA
The "Call to Action" (CTA) is the focal point of conversion optimization. It is the digital "register." The prevailing theory for high-converting buttons is the Von Restorff Effect (or Isolation Effect), which states that an item that "stands out like a sore thumb" is more likely to be remembered and interacted with.23
5.1 The Von Restorff Effect in UI
The Isolation Effect is a cognitive bias where the brain prioritizes the processing of distinct stimuli. In a UI dominated by cool colors (Blues, Greys, Whites), a button that shares those hues (e.g., a Blue button on a Blue background) has low saliency. It requires "top-down" processing (conscious searching). A button in a complementary color (e.g., Orange/Red on Blue) triggers "bottom-up" processing (automatic attention capture).24
5.1.1 The Mechanism of Saliency
Visual saliency is determined by contrast in Color, Orientation, and Size. Of these, Color is the strongest and fastest cue.
* Complementary Contrast: The highest chromatic contrast is found at opposite ends of the color wheel (180° separation).
   * Blue (220°) <-> Orange (40°)
   * Green (120°) <-> Red/Magenta (300°)
5.2 Evidence from Large-Scale A/B Testing
The "Warm CTA on Cool Background" hypothesis is supported by significant industry data.
5.2.1 HubSpot: The Red vs. Green Experiment
One of the most famous case studies in CRO history is the HubSpot "Red vs. Green" button test.4
* The Context: HubSpot’s website design was predominantly Green.
* The Hypothesis: Intuition suggested a Green button would work best because Green means "Go" and fits the brand.
* The Result: The Red button outperformed the Green button by 21%.
* The Insight: The lift was not because Red is inherently better than Green. It was because the Green button blended into the green page design (camouflaged). The Red button created maximum visual isolation against the green background. It leveraged the Von Restorff effect to snap the user's attention.
5.2.2 Unbounce and the "Big Orange Button" (BOB)
Unbounce and other CRO agencies popularized the "Big Orange Button."
* Why Orange? The internet is predominantly Blue (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Word/Outlook). Orange is the exact complementary hue to Blue. Therefore, on the majority of platforms, Orange is the most visually distinct color available.
* Data: Case studies show that changing a CTA color to contrast with the dominant brand color can lift conversions by 18-34%.27
5.3 Exceptions: The Context of Fintech
While "Red on Green" works for marketing, it fails in Fintech.
* The Semantic Override: In banking, Red means "Debt," "Error," or "Stop." Even if a Red button is visually isolated, the semantic association (Behavioral Level processing) overrides the visual saliency.
* The Fintech Solution: Use Vibrant Green (#00C7BE) or Electric Violet on a Navy background. These colors maintain high contrast (Luminosity) without the negative semantic baggage of Red.
Summary for Engine: The recommendation engine must calculate the Complementary Hue of the primary brand color for the CTA. If the Primary is Blue (220°), the CTA must be in the Orange (40°) range to maximize the Isolation Effect. However, it must include a "Semantic Override" for Fintech categories to prevent Red buttons.

6. The 60-30-10 Rule vs. Cognitive Load
The query asks if there is empirical evidence that the 60-30-10 distribution reduces cognitive load. This rule—60% Primary (Neutral), 30% Secondary (Brand), and 10% Accent (CTA)—is a classic interior design principle adapted for UI. While no single study explicitly tests "60-30-10," the underlying principle of Visual Hierarchy and Visual Complexity is robustly supported by Cognitive Load Theory (CLT).
6.1 Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) in UI Design
Cognitive Load refers to the amount of working memory resources used to process information.
* Intrinsic Load: The difficulty of the task itself (e.g., calculating a mortgage rate).
* Extraneous Load: The effort required to process the interface (e.g., decoding a cluttered color scheme to find the "Calculate" button).
* Germane Load: The effort dedicated to learning or processing the actual content.29
A chaotic color palette increases Extraneous Load. If a user has to process five different vibrant colors with equal visual weight, their brain must constantly decode which element is important (is the red box a button? is the green text a link?). This leads to Decision Fatigue and higher abandonment rates.
6.2 Empirical Support: Visual Complexity Studies
Research by Deng & Poole (2010) and Tuch et al. (2012) on Visual Complexity provides the empirical backing for the 60-30-10 rule.30
* The Findings: There is a strong negative correlation between high visual complexity and perceived aesthetics/usability. Websites with Low Visual Complexity (fewer dominant colors, clear grouping) are processed faster and rated as more trustworthy.
* Processing Fluency: The brain prefers stimuli that are easy to process. The 60-30-10 rule creates Processing Fluency by establishing a clear pattern:
   1. 60% Neutral (Backgrounds/Whitespace): Creates "Negative Space." This reduces visual noise and allows the brain to group elements (Gestalt principle of containment). It effectively "nullifies" the processing cost of 60% of the screen.
   2. 30% Secondary (Headers/Cards): Establishes context and brand identity.
   3. 10% Accent (Buttons): Guides the eye to the single most important action.
6.3 The Engine Logic: Ratio Enforcement
The engine cannot simply provide a palette of 5 colors; it must tag them by usage weight.
* Failure Mode: A palette of 5 colors where all are highly saturated and used equally results in a "Fruit Salad" effect—high complexity, high load, low conversion.
* Success Mode: The engine must designate a Primary_Background (High Luminance/Low Saturation) that occupies 60% of the pixel area in the preview. This demonstrates the functional relationship of the colors, not just their aesthetic harmony.32
________________
7. Luminosity and Accessibility: The Biological Constraints of Retention
While hue drives emotion, Luminosity drives readability. Accessibility is no longer an optional "edge case"; it is a retention metric. Low-contrast text causes eye strain (Computer Vision Syndrome), leading to rapid session abandonment and reduced "Time on Site."
7.1 The Contrast Ratio Standards (WCAG)
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) mandate specific contrast ratios based on the physiology of visual perception.3
* 4.5:1 for normal text (AA Level).
* 3:1 for large text/graphics.
* 7:1 for AAA compliance.
A/B tests have shown that improving text contrast can directly impact readability metrics (reading speed) and comprehension. Nielsen Norman Group emphasizes that "legibility" is the prerequisite for "usability".35
7.2 The >90% or <15% Luminosity Rule
To ensure sufficient contrast for content-heavy apps, background luminosity tends to polarize. The "Middle Greys" are the danger zone.
7.2.1 The Light Mode Standard (>90%)
Backgrounds in light mode should be >90% Brightness (e.g., #F2F2F2 to #FFFFFF).
   * The Math: If a background has 50% Luminance (Mid-Grey), it is mathematically impossible to achieve a 7:1 contrast ratio with either Black or White text. The background is too dark for black text and too light for white text.
   * Retention: High-luminance backgrounds (with dark text) mimic paper, capitalizing on centuries of reading conditioning.
7.2.2 The Dark Mode Standard (<15%)
Backgrounds in dark mode should be <15% Brightness (e.g., #121212).
   * The "Pure Black" Fallacy: Material Design guidelines explicitly warn against using pure black (#000000) for surfaces.
   1. Smearing: On OLED screens, pure black pixels are turned off. When scrolling, turning them on takes a fraction of a second, causing a "smear" or "ghosting" effect that feels laggy.
   2. Halation: White text on pure Black creates the highest possible contrast, which can cause the text to visually "bleed" or "vibrate."
   * The Solution: Using Dark Grey (#121212) reduces the contrast slightly to a comfortable level, prevents OLED smear, and allows "shadows" (using pure black) to be visible, maintaining depth cues.37
Summary for Engine: The engine must possess a Contrast Checker logic. It should auto-reject palettes where the primary text color and primary background color fail the 4.5:1 ratio. It should specifically recommend #121212 over #000000 for Dark Mode backgrounds.

9. Conclusion: Implementing the "Chroma-Logic"
The research confirms that color optimization is a quantifiable science, not a subjective art. For the color palette visualizer app, the "recommendation engine" should not be a random generator but a rules-based system governed by the behavioral constraints identified in this report.
Key Algorithmic Rules for the Engine:
   1. The 50ms Gate: All generated palettes must pass a contrast check. Primary Text vs. Background must exceed 4.5:1.
   2. The Trust Anchor: If the user selects "Finance/Business," force the inclusion of a Blue/Slate hue (200-240°) in the Secondary slot.
   3. The Conversion Spike: For all categories, calculate the Complementary Hue of the Secondary slot and assign it to the Accent (CTA) slot to leverage the Isolation Effect.
   4. The Load Balancer: Enforce the 60-30-10 ratio in the visualizer preview. Do not show 5 equal stripes of color; show a mock interface layout to demonstrate the hierarchy.
   5. The Sophistication Filter: If "Luxury" or "Minimalist" is selected, apply a Saturation Cap (<40%) to all non-accent colors and prioritize Tones over Tints.
   6. The Dark Mode Safety Protocol: If the user selects Dark Mode, replace #000000 with #121212 to prevent OLED smearing and improve halation.
By adhering to these parameters, the app will not merely suggest "pretty" colors; it will engineer high-performance user interfaces that align with the biological and psychological realities of human perception. The data is clear: in the economy of attention, color is the currency, and only those who understand its physics will remain solvent.
